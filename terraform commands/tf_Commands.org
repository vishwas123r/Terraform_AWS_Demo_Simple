The command that helps you get to know that you have installed the terrafrom correctly is 


=terraform -v= and =terraform=


The Command which is used in initiliazing the state files and the varaibles is 


=terraform init=

and to run and apply the infrastructure that you have coded you can use the command


=terraform apply=


now that you have applied all the code and you want to get to know how the state of the infrasture then you can use the command

=terraform state list=


=terraform state show=


then if you feel like you need to know some more insights about the state of even a part of the infrastrue you can go and use the command =terraform state show <Infrastructure_that_you_want_to_see_the_state>=


in the code that you write you can use the =output= command in the program and get the output


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
output "server_<property>" {
    value = <provider>_<service>.<name_in_program>.<property>
}
#+END_EXAMPLE


and then you can go and run this command and get the autput


=terraform apply --auto-approve= - the output that we desired is on command prompt with the `green text`


if you want to destoty a infrasture you can use the command =terraform destroy= but when you want to destroy and instance you can use the command =terraform destroy -target <instance_name_in_program{no id added here}>=


and similarly if we want to apply a part of the infrastructure we can do it using the command =terraform apply -target <instance_name_in_program{no id added here}>= 


Alright now that we have hardcoded a lot of the instances we should have to go and get the understanding of the variable.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
variable "name_for_the_variable" {
    description = "Some text to show up"
    default = <a Value> #you can try writing some value for the varaible where the user need not have to explicitly program it in the later part
    type = "<varialbe_type>" #you can specify which is the type of varailbe that you want the user to pass as a parameter
}
#+END_EXAMPLE


and to reference the variable you can use the syntax


=var.<name_for_the_variable>=


and if you list the varaibles then you can go and write the code in the =terraform.tfvars= as a list 


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
variable_name = variable_value["i[0]","i[1]"]
#+END_EXAMPLE


then in the program you can write it as =var.variable_name[<index>]=


and now in the command prompt you can go and write the command after writing the above code is by the command = terraform apply -var "<name_for_the_variable> <value_for_name_for_the_variable>" =


**remember this value and name_for_the_variable has to be written in double quotes**


Also the other method is by writing it on *terraform.tfvars* file.

inside the *terraform.tfvars* file go and write the 
=<name_for_the_variable> = "value of th name_for_the_variable"=


Then if you do =terraform apply= then you need not have to apply it once again you can get you infrastructure ready.
